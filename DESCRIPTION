Description: This is a simple one-function package to calculate the amount of carbon stored (in above ground biomass and in soil) and sequestered by prioirty habitats in the UK.  
  This is based on Field et al. (2020) The value of habitats of conservation importance to climate change mitigation in the UK. Biological Conservation, vol. 248. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108619
  Carbon storage and sequestration values are taken from Taylor et al. (2019) High carbon burial rates by small ponds in the landscape. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. vol. 17. https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.1988
  The package also uses soil carbon data from the FAO Global Soil Organic Carbon Map. http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/pillars-action/4-information-and-data-new/global-soil-organic-carbon-gsoc-map/en/
